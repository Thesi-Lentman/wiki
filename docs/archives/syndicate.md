# Invictus Syndicate

![syndicate](/img/archives/syndicate.png)

The Invictus Syndicate is a mysterious group operating in the shadows of Lemuria. The Syndicate's aims are destructive, and they have no qualms about hurting innocents to get what they want. It is therefore a main duty of the Lemurian Guild to fight back against the Syndicate's goals. They appear to use a portal magic similar to the Guild's portal to move agents around the world. The details of their portal and differences to the guild's portal are currently unknown.

The Syndicate uses a branch and cell structure which makes rooting out the entire organization difficult, if not impossible. Often agents in a cell will have very few details about what they are doing, why they are doing it, or even the identity of their immediate superior. Branches seem to work independently of one another and have at times even seemed at odds with one another. Still Syndicate agents, especially those in leadership positions, are extremely powerful and are not to be taken lightly.

## Past Interactions with the Guild

### Enhanced Serial Killer

The Guild was sent to stop a a wave of serial killings. During the mission they were able to recover the body of one of the serial killers. Rikku examined the corpse and determined that the body was physically enhanced through alchemy. A side effect of the treatment was deterioration of sections of the brain.

### Guild Attack

The Syndicate was able to launch a surprise attack on Guild headquarters by taking control of the portal and sending multiple teams in to attack. The Guild was able to repell attackers in the Library and the Archives. After the attack was repelled it was determined that the Tavern Trio (Yuna, Rikku, and Paine) were kidnapped in the attack.

### Sleeper Agent in the Guild

The resident portal expert, Zeradnyk (former Syndicate employee), was caught trying to break into the Vault below the Guild and steal the Heart of Strife. The guild team prevented the theft, but Zeradnyk was killed in the figth due to a Ring of Loyalty. Zeradnyk has since been assumed as the reason the Syndicate was able to use the Guild portal in their attack.

### The Black Dragon Ceremony

A huge pulse of magic alerted the Guild to Syndicate activity. The Guild was able to pinpoint the source of the pulse to the Swamps of Duloc. All available members were sent to the Swamps to stop the Syndicate. They found a ritual being performed to transform Yuna into the Black Dragon. Only Feirfiz was able to reach Yuna. He was not able to rescue her and had to kill her before the ritual was completed. As Feirfiz struck her down Yuna was able to say, "Thank you."

### Capture of Numrikar and Rezzir

A Dr. Mauro was demonstrating a soldier enhancing potion for the army. The test subject, Jed, took the potion and went on a rampage. The guild sent a team to stop Jed. They were successful, but Dr. Mauro escaped. In addition, Numrikar and Rezzir investigated a portal that was left open. The portal closed behind them and they are assumed captured by the Syndicate.

### Attack on Dow Chemical

The guild responded to an attack on the City of Dow. They dispatched a couple waves of attacking mephitis and rescued many citizens in the attack. Toward the end of the mission they stumbled upon a crew of people taking alchemy ingredients out of the Dow Chemical factory through a magic portal. The Guild sent a team to investigate. The team was able to link the the portal to past missions with the Syndicate. They came to the conclusion that James Son of Hen was a Syndicate agent that infiltrated the factory, then started the Mephiti attack and opened the portal. The Mephiti attack was most likely a cover for the alchemical component theft.

### Guild Outpost Attack

A guild outpost sent a message that it was being attacked. A team was sent and encountered two Alchemically Enhanced soldiers slaughtering the Guild members at the outpost. During the encounter the team discovered that an invisible magic caster, Doc, was supervising the attack and taking notes. The two enhanced soldiers were defeated and Doc escaped through a Syndicate portal. The corpses of the soldiers were brought back to Guild Headquarters and Gaille was able to question them. We were able to learn that the Syndicate was testing an updated version of their alchemical super soldier serum that had been administered at a Rae Lake village lab.

### Syndicate Base

A group of several guild members were teleported to Carmel. In trying to find a way back home, a few members (Red Paw, Gaille, Teddy, Ulkhur, and IT) found a Syndicate operation at a tomb and followed them through the Syndicate escape portal. They were captured and used as humanoid guinea pigs for several potions that gave a variety of effects. Through their escape, the guild members found that kids were being recruited to the Syndicate and several members were stuck there out of fear. They were able to return to the guild thanks to the help of Zeradnyk and brought him back with them.
